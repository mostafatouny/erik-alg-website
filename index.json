Those are algorihtms, competitive programming, quantitative methods for computer science, and finally a two weeks research guidance course. Mostafa expressed his gratitude, to be able to communicate with others during his military service.   Weekly Meeting (19/03/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Follow-up what each member has been self-studying,and exchanging feedbacks.  Summary\n Caio\u0026rsquo;s master thesis is going to use logic technique and rigour. That\u0026rsquo;s why he is interested in learning discrete math and logic through Rosen\u0026rsquo;s book. Master is probably going to be about program verification and hardware algorithms like registers allocation problem. Mostafa, besides rosen\u0026rsquo;s book, recommends book of proof and Applied Logic for Computer Scientists. Lucas is already familiar with discrete math and logic; What is missing from him is the capability of applying them in algorithms context. Currently he is training on graph and greedy algorithms through Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach Lucas asked Mostafa about theoretical CS, where he wishes to know whether reductions and NP-completeness proofs are accessble with minimal background in algorithms. Lucas also noted Bondy and Murty\u0026rsquo;s graph theory book contains a chapter about complexity theory even though the book is not about algorithms. He wondered whether only combinatorics are sufficient to achieve a progress. Mostafa confirms theoretical CS is can be approached mainly through combinatorics; Generally, It can approached by algorithms or logic as well. Lucas praised erik\u0026rsquo;s super collaboration. He loves also to tackle open problems in graph theory, while they are not related to his main research field, which is computational biology. He talked about genome assembly problem, which is heavily based on graph theory, particularly hamiltonian paths. Mostafa showed MAA magazines, illustrating its goal for exposing ideas to a wider audience, captivating their interest in a way that invokes a discussion. The meeting has ended-up where everyone achnowledged the value of exchanging perspectives. It is hoped members share more technical ideas after having achieved a good technical progress.  Quotes\n Caio: I do really appreciate the discussion.   Weekly Meeting: Revamping The Group (19/03/2022) induction, goal of studying algorithms from math/logic perspective, master about proving properties about programs, program verification, algorithms of hardware like reigsters allocation\nmostafa recommended\nfamiliar with discrete math and logic, missing is applying logic in algorithms, goal is graph and greedy algorithms\nlucas: asked about theoretical computer science, wishes to know more about reductions and prove NP-completeness, and design approximation algorithms. talked about graph theory book and notable its sections on complexity even though it\u0026rsquo;s not about algorithms. wondered whether discrete math is sufficient to tackle complexity and reduction proofs, and whether he need algorithms\nmostafa: confirmed TCS is approachable only through combinatorics, along algorithms and logic\nlucas: touched on erik\u0026rsquo;s super collaboration. loves to tackle open problems in graph theory, as it\u0026rsquo;s not related to his main research field, which is computational biology. genome assembly is heavily based on graph theory, particularly hamiltonian paths\nmostafa: showed MAA magazines, illustrated its goal for wider audience, and goal of re-exposing curious ideas, to invoke discussions and captivate the interest of readers.\n Weekly Meeting: Revamping The Group (12/03/2022) Links\n Audio Slides  Objectives\n Revamping the group, re-launching totally new activities and approach.  Summary\n Launching new activities which require minimal time, technical background, and commitment. We are going to begin with those, Then slowly endorse more collaborative activities. That, In order for everything to be clear.  Quotes\n mostafa: I had two big false assumptions about this group, time and background.   Weekly Meeting: More Courses (26/02/2022) Links\n Audio Slides  Objective\n Address the challenges the group is facing. Suggest more elementary courses to pursued, and how to use the three of them simultaneously.  Quotes\n protechthor: I do really appreciate that we can pick-up more courses.   Weekly Meeting (19/02/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Follow-up what members have achieved of Erik\u0026rsquo;s course, and discuss their solved assignments.  Summary\n Everyone expressed struggling with the course, and nearly all members couldn\u0026rsquo;t solve the exercises.  Quotes\n mostafa: I am encouraged by everyone\u0026rsquo;s willingness to express her/his struggle, and to persistently learn from mistakes and improve.   Weekly Meeting (12/02/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Technical discussion, Lectures and Assignment 1. Casual discussion, whether the course was too difficult. Casual discussion, Generally related to the course. Social, Meeting new members.  Summary\n ben introduces himself: graduated from math major, transitioned to software industry and has been working for 2 years. intersted now in theoretical computer science. caio introduces himself: fresh CS alumni; currently pursuing a master in compilers; motivated to study algorithms for code optimization. lucper and caio are friends and had an internships together. most members did not solve assignment 1 but they are planning for it the next week end. for most members, this course is the first time they see proofs within the context of algorithms. ben initiates a discussion, simple algorithm but tricky proof  mostafa addressed understanding a solution, and being able to creatively come up with a new, are totally two different skills. lucper addresses that happens very commonly in combinatorics, A problem easily understood but very trikcy to solve it.   ben asks whether it is a pattern for greedy algorithms to be solved by induction  mostafa answers when an algorithm is formulated recursively or in terms of smaller instances of the same problem, Then induction is a very likely approach. caio agrees what mostafa as he had a similar advice from his professor. lucper pointes to algorithm design book by Kleinberg and Tardos for an alternative proof by contradiction   mostafa initaties a discussion, school systems are not the best environment for training on creatively coming up with novel ideas. mostafa initaites a discussion, thinking of simpler problems or different versions as a problem solving strategy.  ben expresses this is his main strategy. caio mentions a quote from how to prove it by George Polya. lucper agrees.   mostafa ends up the with posing a question: If progressing slowly by thinking of related problems is our sole approach for progress, Is it possible to achieve breakthroughs or unexpected leaps?  Quotes\n caio: if you cannot solve a problem, try to think of an easier version for it.   First Meeting (05/02/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Networking, Where Members introduce themselves (15 min) Discussion, On students' collaboration and online communities; Their challenges and suggested solutions (20 min) Discussion, On members' skills and goals, and how to leverage that for Projects and subsidy learning (10 min) Gaming, Multiplayer among members (5 min)  Summary\n  members introduce themselves\n lucas: Brazil; Master student in computational biology; Had an unfinished grad course in algorithms; Aims for advanced topics in algorithms. protechthor: Cameron; Math+CS Undergrad; Aims for competitive programming and technical interviews. salvaCasta: Argentina; Undergrad special degree of Engineering and CS with equivalent to a master. took a first course in algorithms. wishes to prepare for hard courses. self-studies measure theory. likes information theory and prepares for it by analysis tilde: Sweden; Undergrad special degree of CS and Engineering equivalent to a Master; Interested in Machine Learning; Has solid background in Algorithms and Data structures. Aims for proofs lens of algorithms; Collaborated with mechatronics and political sciences students ashok: Fresh highschool alumni; Familiar with programming and done machine learning projects; Lacks advanced math and foundational algorithms.    mostafa pointed to curious intersections between computer science and information/communication.\n  protechthor expressed struggling with measure theory, as there\u0026rsquo;s no clear motivation for it; it is too way abstract. mostafa offered help through mathematical logic for appreciating rigorous approaches.\n  mostafa addressed that members might consider practical programming side of algorithms, besides course\u0026rsquo;s main goal of proofs.\n  ashok explained how Physics might contribute to computing, as processing power is physically realized through the laws of physics.\n  Members talked about the first picture of a blackhole (see this)\n  Quotes\n salvaCasta: I love it, definitely love it. i do not study math at university. so I just buy a book and try to do every exercise. salvaCasta: Some proofs are just very hard to come up with, but not in technical terms, but rather in creative terms. mostafa: I am sure you will learn alot from this community, ashok .. let me stress the benefit is mutual. I am going to learn from ashok. mostafa: Eventhough ashok is a fresh high school alumini, He was able to actively participate in our discussion. tilde: A course where most of the students participated in the meeting. The teacher created an environment where you felt comfortable to ask questions, even if they felt stupid. He never disregarded those questions. He also started every lecture with a very basic down to earth explanation.
