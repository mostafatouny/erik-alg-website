Aims for proofs lens of algorithms; Collaborated with mechatronics and political sciences students ashok: Fresh highschool alumni; Familiar with programming and done machine learning projects; Lacks advanced math and foundational algorithms.    mostafa pointed to curious intersections between computer science and information/communication.\n  protechthor expressed struggling with measure theory, as there\u0026rsquo;s no clear motivation for it; it is too way abstract. mostafa offered help through mathematical logic for appreciating rigorous approaches.\n  mostafa addressed that members might consider practical programming side of algorithms, besides course\u0026rsquo;s main goal of proofs.\n  ashok explained how Physics might contribute to computing, as processing power is physically realized through the laws of physics.\n  Members talked about the first picture of a blackhole (see this)\n    Quotes\n salvaCasta: I love it, definitely love it. i do not study math at university. so I just buy a book and try to do every exercise. salvaCasta: Some proofs are just very hard to come up with, but not in technical terms, but rather in creative terms. mostafa: I am sure you will learn alot from this community, ashok .. let me stress the benefit is mutual. I am going to learn from ashok. mostafa: Eventhough ashok is a fresh high school alumini, He was able to actively participate in our discussion. tilde: A course where most of the students participated in the meeting. The teacher created an environment where you felt comfortable to ask questions, even if they felt stupid. He never disregarded those questions. He also started every lecture with a very basic down to earth explanation.
