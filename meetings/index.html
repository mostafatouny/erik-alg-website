<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Mostafa</em> recaped his self-study plans. Namely, Wong&rsquo;s intro of quantum computing, Mathematics for Machine Learning book, Ryan O&rsquo;donnell&rsquo;s undergrad complexity course, and Mehdi&rsquo;s calculus problem solving book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Caio</em> talked about his scientific communication course at his university. It spanned how to make slides easier to follow and understand, and techniques for writing scientific papers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Caio</em> also talked about his coursework, Including divide and conquer algorithms, like merge sort, and how to solve recurrence relations using methods like the master method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Caio</em> had a presented yesterday about <em>side-channel attacks</em>, Related computer security. He briefly explained it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> recognized Mathematics for Machine Learning book presented by <em>Mostafa</em> as he had studied from previously. He saved O&rsquo;donnell&rsquo;s playlist of complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> reviewed recurrence relations, and divide and conquer algorithms like <em>caio</em>. He also invests much time in linear algebra through strang&rsquo;s famous course on MITOpenCourseWare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> was surprised how his advisor was able to summarize a lot of his works in a single page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> joked with <em>Mostafa</em>, The many endeavors he is pursuing. <em>Mostafa</em> replied while he is good at picking multiple studies simultaenously, He wishes if he well advanced in any of them, Especially since his time is limited due to his obligatory military service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> expressed interest in compiler design of quantum computing, and wishes to explore it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mostafa</em> asked <em>Caio</em> in which sense participants benefited the most from the his presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Caio</em> stressed the role of promoting a researcher&rsquo;s own work, through a good communication. He had even drawn an analogy with a politician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Caio</em> explained the relationship between <em>side-channel attacks</em>, and algorithms and compilers. Namely, vulnerabilities introduced by the compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lucas</em> ended the meeting by reminding everyone the goal of this group, which is sharing solutions of selected exercises.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Caio</em>: &ldquo;In the end, People are there because they want to learn something. My professor showed a politician&rsquo;s style is focused on people, and he wanna make sure what he is doing is for people&rsquo;s benefit. The same applies to a scientist, since the contribution is for the scientific society. Such skills translates well to scientific sharing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Lucas</em>: &ldquo;I am surprised by my mentor&rsquo;s geometric intuition, and he is able to connect various concepts altogether&rdquo;</li>

<p>Objectives</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow-up what each member has been self-studying,and exchanging feedbacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Caio</em>&rsquo;s master thesis is going to use logic technique and rigour. That&rsquo;s why he is interested in learning discrete math and logic through Rosen&rsquo;s book. Master is probably going to be about program verification and hardware algorithms like registers allocation problem.</li>
<li><em>Mostafa</em>, besides rosen&rsquo;s book, recommends <a href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/">book of proof</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-51653-0">Applied Logic for Computer Scientists</a>.</li>
<li><em>Lucas</em> is already familiar with discrete math and logic; What is missing from him is the capability of applying them in algorithms context. Currently he is training on graph and greedy algorithms through <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Manber-Algorithms-A-Creative-Approach/PGM13009.html">Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach</a></li>
<li><em>Lucas</em> asked <em>Mostafa</em> about theoretical CS, where he wishes to know whether reductions and NP-completeness proofs are accessble with minimal background in algorithms. <em>Lucas</em> also noted <a href="https://link.springer.com/gp/book/9781846289699">Bondy and Murty&rsquo;s graph theory</a> book contains a chapter about complexity theory even though the book is not about algorithms. He wondered whether only combinatorics are sufficient to achieve a progress.</li>
<li><em>Mostafa</em> confirms theoretical CS is can be approached mainly through combinatorics; Generally, It can approached by algorithms or logic as well.</li>
<li><em>Lucas</em> praised <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/supercollaboration/">erik&rsquo;s super collaboration</a>. He loves also to tackle open problems in graph theory, while they are not related to his main research field, which is computational biology. He talked about genome assembly problem, which is heavily based on graph theory, particularly hamiltonian paths.</li>
<li><em>Mostafa</em> showed <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/umma20/95/1?nav=tocList">MAA magazines</a>, illustrating its goal for exposing ideas to a wider audience, captivating their interest in a way that invokes a discussion.</li>
<li>The meeting has ended-up where everyone achnowledged the value of exchanging perspectives. It is hoped members share more technical ideas after having achieved a good technical progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Caio:</em> I do really appreciate the discussion.</li>

<li><em>mostafa</em> addressed understanding a solution, and being able to creatively come up with a new, are totally two different skills.</li>
<li><em>lucper</em> addresses that happens very commonly in combinatorics, A problem easily understood but very trikcy to solve it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>ben</em> asks whether it is a pattern for greedy algorithms to be solved by induction
<ul>
<li><em>mostafa</em> answers when an algorithm is formulated recursively or in terms of smaller instances of the same problem, Then induction is a very likely approach.</li>
<li><em>caio</em> agrees what <em>mostafa</em> as he had a similar advice from his professor.</li>
<li><em>lucper</em> pointes to algorithm design book by Kleinberg and Tardos for an alternative proof by contradiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>mostafa</em> initaties a discussion, school systems are not the best environment for training on creatively coming up with novel ideas.</li>
<li><em>mostafa</em> initaites a discussion, thinking of simpler problems or different versions as a problem solving strategy.
<ul>
<li><em>ben</em> expresses this is his main strategy.</li>
<li><em>caio</em> mentions a quote from how to prove it by George Polya.</li>
<li><em>lucper</em> agrees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>mostafa</em> ends up the with posing a question: If progressing slowly by thinking of related problems is our sole approach for progress, Is it possible to achieve breakthroughs or unexpected leaps?</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>caio</em>: if you cannot solve a problem, try to think of an easier version for it.</li>

<li>Networking, Where Members introduce themselves <em>(15 min)</em></li>
<li>Discussion, On students' collaboration and online communities; Their challenges and suggested solutions  <em>(20 min)</em></li>
<li>Discussion, On members' skills and goals, and how to leverage that for Projects and subsidy learning <em>(10 min)</em></li>
<li>Gaming, Multiplayer among members <em>(5 min)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>members introduce themselves</p>
<ul>
<li><em>lucas</em>: Brazil; Master student in computational biology; Had an unfinished grad course in algorithms; Aims for advanced topics in algorithms.</li>
<li><em>protechthor</em>: Cameron; Math+CS Undergrad; Aims for competitive programming and technical interviews.</li>
<li><em>salvaCasta</em>: Argentina; Undergrad special degree of Engineering and CS with equivalent to a master. took a first course in algorithms. wishes to prepare for hard courses. self-studies measure theory. likes information theory and prepares for it by analysis</li>
<li><em>tilde</em>: Sweden; Undergrad special degree of CS and Engineering equivalent to a Master; Interested in Machine Learning; Has solid background in Algorithms and Data structures. Aims for proofs lens of algorithms; Collaborated with mechatronics and political sciences students</li>
<li><em>ashok</em>: Fresh highschool alumni; Familiar with programming and done machine learning projects; Lacks advanced math and foundational algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>mostafa</em> pointed to curious intersections between computer science and information/communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>protechthor</em> expressed struggling with measure theory, as there&rsquo;s no clear motivation for it; it is too way abstract. <em>mostafa</em> offered help through mathematical logic for appreciating rigorous approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>mostafa</em> addressed that members might consider practical programming side of algorithms, besides course&rsquo;s main goal of proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ashok</em> explained how Physics might contribute to computing, as processing power is physically realized through the laws of physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members talked about the first picture of a blackhole (see <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/black-hole-first-photo-event-horizon-telescope">this</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quotes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>salvaCasta</em>: I love it, definitely love it. i do not study math at university. so I just buy a book and try to do every exercise.</li>
<li><em>salvaCasta</em>: Some proofs are just very hard to come up with, but not in technical terms, but rather in creative terms.</li>
<li><em>mostafa</em>: I am sure you will learn alot from this community, <em>ashok</em> .. let me stress the benefit is mutual. I am going to learn from <em>ashok</em>.</li>
<li><em>mostafa</em>: Eventhough <em>ashok</em> is a fresh high school alumini, He was able to actively participate in our discussion.</li>
<li><em>tilde</em>: A course where most of the students participated in the meeting. The teacher created an environment where you felt comfortable to ask questions, even if they felt stupid. He never disregarded those questions. He also started every lecture with a very basic down to earth explanation.</li>
